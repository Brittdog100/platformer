# platformer
<p>This is a platforming game I made for my final project in high school computer science.
The course never went into Swing components really, but I taught myself Swing fairly early
in. Again, the project was very much outside the scope of the class, but since the assignment
was independent study, I did it anyway.</p>
<p>There are some inefficiencies that mostly just stem from the scope of the class;
the graphics are, I think, CPU driven, and I could probably use actual rendering
frameworks if I had the time and the motivation. A lot of this stuff uses some weird
mixture of Java's AWT and Swing toolkits, both of which are now obsolete. It was fun while it
lasted, I suppose.</p>
<p>I probably could've done a better job putting it on GitHub, but that's neither here nor there.</p>
